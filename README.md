## General info
Coding Focus is a creative-coding prototype that explores how music can be used to improve classroom focus and engagement for young students. Built in TunePad, the project demonstrates how simple loops, chords and rhythm structures—coded using Python-style logic—can create calm, predictable soundscapes that support concentration. The work draws on research linking music, memory, and cognitive development, and uses feedback from real classroom testing to refine each track. The final prototype includes three coded songs: Calm Focus Loop, Focus Flow, and Mind Garden, each designed for different stages of a class environment.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
**TunePad** – where all the coding and music creation happened  
**Python-style code** – used for sequencing notes, instruments and loops  
**GitHub** – hosting space for my final prototype and reflection 

## Features

- **Three original coded songs**, each designed to help young students maintain focus during class:  
  1. **Calm Focus Loop** – soft drum groove, ambient keys and low bass to promote calm concentration.  
  2. **Focus Flow** – gentle rhythm and melodic arpeggios for steady, mid-level focus.  
  3. **Mind Garden** – playful marimba tones and evolving chords for creativity and mental refresh.

- **Layered musical structure** – each track combines multiple instruments (drums, keys, bass, ambience) through TunePad’s layering tools.
- **Repetition and variation** – code uses loops and changes in pitch, filter, and velocity to balance predictability with interest.
- **Research-informed design** – guided by studies (Schellenberg, 2005; Roden et al., 2012) linking rhythm and repetition to attention and memory.
- **Commented code** – each section of the songs includes clear explanations for educational and marking purposes.
- **TunePad integration** – built using TunePad’s Python-style commands (`playNote`, `rest`, `with lowpass`, etc.).
	
## Setup
This project was created using **TunePad**, a Python-based coding environment for music creation.

### View and play in TunePad
1. Visit the linked TunePad projects:
   - Calm Focus Loop → https://tunepad.com/project/113871  
   - Focus Flow → https://tunepad.com/project/117169  
   - Mind Garden → https://tunepad.com/project/117182

## **Usage**
Once the project is open:

1. In TunePad, press **Play** to hear the composition.
2. Use the code comments to follow how each instrument or loop is written.
4. The code in this repo mirrors the TunePad version but won’t produce sound in plain Python.

## Project Status

Status: ✅ **Final Prototype Submitted**

All three coded compositions (Calm Focus Loop, Focus Flow, and Mind Garden) are complete and published on TunePad.  
This repository includes:
- full source code for reference,
- and valid links to each TunePad project (checked 04/11/25).

No earlier working versions were developed beyond the final TunePad submissions.
